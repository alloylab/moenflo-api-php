# MoenFlo API PHP

This is an intial implemntation of the MoenFlo API in PHP. Please keep in my mind that MoenFlo has not yet documented their API, so this has required some work to figure out their API. I have spoken with their support teams and there are plans to have a publlished API later this year.

I will be continuing to build out the API over the next couple of months.

FYI, This is a mirrored Git Repo from: https://git.alloylab.com/open-source/moenflo-api-php
But please open all issues here on GitHub, I use Gitlab for the CI/CD workflows.

Thanks!
